"Notes"
"Total cases and/or deaths in each state may not sum to 100% due to rounding or pending or missing information. Where possible, percentages are based on a total of all probable and confirmed cases and deaths for which race/ethnicity is available, including those with unknown race/ethnicity. Shares of cases and deaths may not be directly comparable due to differences in reporting periods and/or rates of unknown race/ethnicity. Some states report data on cases and deaths for Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander individuals, but data are insufficient for comparisons to total population distribution. "
""
"Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race. States vary in whether they include or exclude Hispanic individuals from race categories. States that include Hispanic individuals in race categories are indicated by a ""Yes"" in the ""Race Categories Include Hispanic Individuals"" column. In the other states, these groups only include non-Hispanic individuals."

"2. Individuals may identify as more than one race or ethnicity; totals may not sum to 100%. Population estimates are based on exclusive race categories, and should not be compared to the share cases/deaths."
"3. The Vermont state website reports cases and deaths based on known race/ethnicity, and provides rounded case counts for White individuals and non-Hispanic individuals. The share of cases for White individuals, non-Hispanic individuals, and unknown race were imputed based on available information from the state website."
