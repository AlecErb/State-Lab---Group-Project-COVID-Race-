Outline

We are all aware that there is a material correlation shown between race and COVID infections [Show graph below]. While some of this causation can be associated with genetic differences between races, we believe that there are substantial selection biases between different races owing to the correlation between race and COVID infections having to do with poverty, access to healthcare, geographic factors, and education.
